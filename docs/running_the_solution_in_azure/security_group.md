# Security Group

## Getting Started

The Security Group will be used to grant access and permissions to predefined users to the application. 

To create the **Security Group** and **add members**, review the following Microsoft [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal#create-a-basic-group-and-add-members).

### Seetings:

- ***GroupType:*** Select the group type **Security**. 
- ***Name:*** A meaningfull name.
- ***Membership type:*** Select **Assigned** membership for the group.

> NOTE: This is not an application but an Azure AD security group. Only people added as a **member** of this group will be able to operate the solution through the Management API.
