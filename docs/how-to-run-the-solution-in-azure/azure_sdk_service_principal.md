# Azure SDK Service Principal

## Getting Started

The solution has components that require interaction with Azure resources using the Azure SDK. To allow this interaction, we need to create a Service Principal for the solution and assign it `Contributor` access to the specified Azure Resources. In this guide, we are going to explain how to assing the role to the app registration created in previous steps.

You will need the id and secret of this service principal to [configure the Pipeline's libraries]() for the deployments.

### Assign Contributor Role
For the time being, the solution needs to interact with the virtual machine where the Bot Service API is hosted (to turn on/turn off the virtual machine), so we have to go to the resource group where the virtual machine was created and through Access Control (IAM) assign `Contributor` role to the application (check [How to assign a role to an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#assign-a-role-to-the-application)).
