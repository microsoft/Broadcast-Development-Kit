         * The beginning of each NALU is prefixed by one of the following byte sequences (depending on the implementation of the encoder):
         *      0x00 00 01
         *      0x00 00 00 01
         *
         * The following byte contains the NALU type in the lower 5 bits of the value. As a simplification, if the value is 5 (0 0101) then the NALU correspond to an I-Frame.
         * A single frame in H264 is composed of multiple NALUs, but since we only care about detecting the presence of an I-frame
         * we can simply search for this byte sequence to identify if the frame is an I-Frame or not.
         *
         * Based on some tests, it seem that the NALU we are looking for starts at the ~28 byte of the buffer, but it can move over time as other NALUs change in size.
         * As an optimization we allow to limit how many position of the array we will check before assuming it's not an I-frame.
         * With a limit of 100, this method should take ~0.002ms to run.
